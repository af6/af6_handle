# Introduction
This repository is property of @iHateRa1n / @af6 (same person) and only this person. 
Oh, and so is the @af6 handle. 
# Discovery
A while ago, I stumbled across some code on GitHub Gist that will find unused Twitter and GitHub usernames. 
Many hours later, I had modified the program A TON. I got every single available 3 character GitHub username into a txt file. So, I also modified the program to give me 4 character usernames. The next day, I am at 100000 usernames. It found (I think) about 113000. I don't have the 4 character usernames, but I do have the 3 character usernames. 
# Rediscovery
Today, I remembered about the GitHub usernames. So I logged onto DropBox and tried a load of 2 character usernames, nope. None worked. Now, I realized most 3 character usernames I found ages ago still work. So I found the "af6" handle and successfully registered it. And I love it. 
# Get your own! 
If you want your own, I sometimes giveaway them on Twitter, so follow me on Twitter ( https://www.twitter.com/iHateRa1n )
And take care of the handle, these handles are getting rarer, and rarer. But, there should be enough for a considerable amount of people to get their own 3 character handle. I'll see you on Twitter and maybe again on GitHub!
